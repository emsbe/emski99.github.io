Many people in the Harry Potter series think she is a strange girl. This has led to her having the nickname "Loony Lovegood", but she does not change herself.

She was in her first year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Harry Potter's second year Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and was in her fourth year when she first came into the series.
